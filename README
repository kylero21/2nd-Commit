<h1>CSB LIFE</h1>
<h3>New Role </h3>                 2nd COMMIT
<p>	Last schools year, I’m just another high school student going to the same school but now,
 I’m here in De La Salle – College of St. Benilde taking up Game Design and Development.
 Adjusting to a new environment is hard, especially when you’re used to a place when you know everyone. 
College for me is tough for there’s a lot of “new” 
will happen like new schedule, new friends, and new life.</p>
<h3>Routine</h3>
<p>Adjusting to college environment forced me to change my everyday routine. When I was in high school, I used to do the same routine over and over again but this year everything changed like, a new schedule perhaps, where I don’t have to go to school every day at the same time, to have lunch and go home at the same time 
school every day at the same time, to have lunch and go home at the same time.</p>
<h3>Relationship</h3>
<body>	Since the first day I enter college, I’ve gain more friends and together we help each other conquering college life. As a student of DLS-CSB, I must put more time and effort in studying because the tuition is very expensive.
 I experienced a more pressure from everyone since I went to this school.

<h3>Assumption</h3>
<p>	In college, I have more time exploring the world of game design for my course is related to what I want to do in the future. Game design and development can improve my gaming skills and also my designing skills. I should me more creative to succeed in this line of business. I know DLS-CSB is ready to guide me all the way to the right path of success. </p>
